# PaymentGateway
The Payment Gateway Service Module

This module create a payment gateway client which initiates payment request and returns the result of the
transactions. Unlike the conventional payment gateway this payment gateway directly debits the
amount from consumer account and credits it into merchant's account and returns the result of
transaction.
